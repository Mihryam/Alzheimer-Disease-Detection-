True Positive (TP): It is the total counts having both predicted and actual values are Demented.
True Negative (TN): It is the total counts having both predicted and actual values are Not Demented.
False Positive (FP): It is the total counts having prediction is Demented while actually Not Demented.
False Negative (FN): It is the total counts having prediction is Not Demented while actually, it is Demented.
