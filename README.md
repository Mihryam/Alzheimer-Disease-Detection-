# REVIEW OF ALGORITHMS

In this project the machine learning algorithms used include:

<li>
<b>SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE: They are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification. It had an accuracy of
<li>
<b>LOGISTIC REGRESSION: It is commonly used for prediction and classification problems. Some of these use cases include: Fraud detection: Logistic regression models can help teams identify data anomalies, which are predictive of fraud. It had an accuracy of
<li>
<b>K NEAREST NEIGHBOUR: It is an algorithm that is used to classify a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. It had an accuracy of
<li>
<b>NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER: It  assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. It had an accuracy of
<li>
<b>DECISION TREE: It is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that uses a set of rules to make decisions, similarly to how humans make decisions. It had an accuracy of 
<li>
<b>RANDOM FOREST:
<li>
<b>XGBOOST: 
<li>
<b>KERAS CLASSIFIER:


# UNDERSTANDING CONFUSION MATRIX
<li>
True Positive (TP): It is the total counts having both predicted and actual values are Demented.
<li>
True Negative (TN): It is the total counts having both predicted and actual values are Not Demented.
<li>
False Positive (FP): It is the total counts having prediction is Demented while actually Not Demented.
<li>
False Negative (FN): It is the total counts having prediction is Not Demented while actually, it is Demented.


Accuracy: This measures how often the model is correct.

Precision: It gives percentage of truly positive prediction. In our case, percentage of dementia patients correctly predicted.

Recall: Of all the positive cases, what percentage are predicted positive?

Sensitivity (sometimes called Recall) measures how good the model is at predicting positives.

This means it looks at true positives and false negatives (which are positives that have been incorrectly predicted as negative).
